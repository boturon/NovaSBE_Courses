What are the 3 papers? They will be based on the identification of socks.
1. Blanchard and Quah (1989) - The Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Demand and Supply Disturbances. Read it all. A classic paper on structural vector auto-regression. for the homework we can use a country and apply the paper.
2. Bernanke, Ben, Jean Bovin, and Piotr Eliasz (2005) - Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy. FAVAR
3. Blanchard, Oliver J., Jean-Paul L'Huiller and Guido Lorenzoni (2013) News, Noise, and Flunctuations: An Empirical Exploration. This will be a signal extracting approach.


We have a simultaneity problem and endogeneity problem. If everything was to be simultanoeus.

\[
C_t=\beta + \alpha C_t+\alpha I_t+\varepsilon_t \\
I_t=\theta C_t-\theta C_{t-1}+\mu_t
\] 

Check:
- Conditional Distribution
- Maximum Likelihood
- Simultaneity
- Joint Distribution
- Random Causality
