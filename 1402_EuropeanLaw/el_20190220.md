CJEU is the formal name of the ECJ (the European Court of Justice).

The ECJ has:
- 1 judge per MS
- 8/9 advocates general: opinion


There are 3 stages in Portugal: 1st instance->appeal->supreme court. Since the first instance, there can be a request for a preliminary ruling.

The preliminary rulings are public on the internet.

When one person and its lawyer decide to go against the EC, the first place to go against is the General Court. Only if the person and the lawyer want to protest the ruling, the can go to the ECJ.

When we see a *P* we know that the GC has commented on it already - the **P** is from appeal. The *C* is for the court of justice and the *T* is for GC.

There are two systmes of interacting with law: Monism and Dualism.

Monism is for lazy people. There is an international organization and a country that wants to get into the first. The idea is that the last law is the one that stands.

The last one to legislate wins. *Lex posterior derogat lex anterior.*

In dualism we say that is a case by case scenario and the principle of the last wins, is verified.
