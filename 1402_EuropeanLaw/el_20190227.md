The 2 cases studied so far were:
1. Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen
2. Costa v ENEL


What the court is trying to say is  that European Law is stronger than National law. It is on appeal that we go back to the ECJ. This case is very important as it shows that the court is protecting the business men.

The case are then:
1. Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen
2. Costa v ENEL
3. Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v Simmenthal SpA


It is important to print, compare the cases to the manual and understand the main ideas. All of them talk about supremacy. The supremacy of a provision of a threaty over national law. The principal lex posterior doesn't apply under EU law.

Can you explain the relaitonsip of the Threaty and the national law?
