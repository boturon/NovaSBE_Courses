*Orsolina Leonesio v Ministero dell'agricoltura e foreste.*

Vertical direct effect means that we can go to the court and simply ask for what one is due.

Most regulations present vertical direct effect. Only a couple of regulations from the EU, have said that the State needs specify the values involved in the regulation.

**Midterm**
1. What is a vertical direct effect?
2. What is direct applicability?

Don't answer the professor. Answer ourselves. Does the answer we give make sense to ourselves?

Read Reiners case on vertical direct effect and then stop. Change source and go study regulation 288, and analyze Orsilna cows.
