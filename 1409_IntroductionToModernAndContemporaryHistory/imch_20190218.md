Discussions will start next week. There will be 4-5 groups per class answering questions. We should read and watch all the respective class materials.

#Japan

Japan, contrarily to China, was able to adapt its institutions.

In Japan, rather than centralized power, there was decentralized power. Even though there was an Emperor, the power was yielded by samurais or shogun. In China there were central powers.

What did samurai adopted from Portuguese culture?
- ideas (conversion to Catholicism)
- technologies (fire guns)
