### Inclusive institutions spread: the French Revolution

French Revolution brought change

French Revolution is a case where liberal ideas took paths that went beyond their original limits.

Immediate conclusion of the French Revolution in 1815 was not in the sense of improving over the liberal legacy. Napoleon not considered a liberal ruler. The main contribution was the coercive manner with which the French Revolution diffused revolutionary, liberal ideas throughout Europe.

This is a period where Great Britain and the USA were experiencing rapid economic growth. France, still  looked to these two cases as evidence that must be some connection between.

Beinning of revolution was less ideological than seems: in particular, as in the case of the English and American revolutions, it stemmed from the issue of financing of wars - in this case, the Seven Years War. The central issue is the tension between the Crown and the Parliament.

French King called Estates General during the Summer of 1789 to ask for financing. Estates General demanded, in exchange, that the Kind answer positively to demands of various social groups. In this process, Estates General promoted themselves to the status of a constituent assembly, i.e., the National Constituent Assembly.

This assembly ignited this revolutionary process, which would lead to a political explosion that erupted in in July 1789. They asked for two demands, which the King readily accepted. Allow society to express itself via ‘books of complaint’, which were spread throughout the country; people made use of them. Allow for double representation in the Estates General. Wanted a doubling on the group of the people to match power of clergy and nobles, which the Kind accepted.

Round shape of the square represented the area of the prison, the Bastille. It was attacked by a mob of revolutionaries that went through the streets attacking the symbols of the traditional path.

Subsequently, the National Constituent Assembly decided to abolish the structure of the Ancien Regime, i.e., the special rights and tributes of the clergy and the nobles. This is again in the context of the three, traditional social groups. There was no mobility between these groups. Some rights: clergy had own laws, own courts, and extracted revenue through taxation. Same with the lords/nobles.

Did not stop here: started increasingly radicalising as time went on, until 1794. Radical left-wing groups began to exert further control in the political process. The peak of violence was reached between 1792 and 1794, i.e., the Jacobin period. This period correspondes to the use of the guillotine as a political instrument.

Jacobines: widespread violence. Used guillotine as political instrument in an indescriminate way. Guillotine was invented to allow for a quicker and less painful death. Jacobines had two interesting features: they were Republicans and Atheists. Something interesting is that our calendar (Greogorian) is religious in origin. Jacobines were so agains the Church and religion, that they decided to change the calendar. Became more connected to nature.

This process begun to calm down and moving in a more conservative direction. In 1799, Napoleon reached power in a coup d’etat and created the Consulate (i.e., a triumvirate). Napoleon becomes the First Consul for life (i.e., a dictator in everything but in name) in 1802, and then Emperor as of 1804.

Most famous military leader was General Napoleon Bonaparte. His sucesses granted him huge popularity, and allowed him to reach power and consolidate it from 1799 onwards. Created an autocratic regime inside France. In external terms, he embarked on an outstanding military adventure that would change the face of Europe, creating an Empire. One of the first politicians to have a sensitivity for PR (imagery; hand inside the jacket, different clothes that were less austentacious, and wore hat in a specific manner).

By 1812, Napoleon was able to dominate much of Europe. What was at stake in the wars? Not just the change of territoroes, but also a change to institutions. In Portugal, for exampe, what did Portuguese King do? Flee to Brazil and stayed there until 1820s. Marked importance in loosening grips over colonies: Brazil had a Portuguese King and would later become independent. The rulers of South America were weakened, putting place Liberal revolutions in this area. The big idea: the spreading of Revolutionary ideas!

The peak for Napoleon was 1812. However, as Napoleon begins to retreats from Moscow and losing territory, this period also marks the beginning of the end.

At some point, loses control over France. Napoleon was exiled to isle of ?. Later able to organise forces, went to Marsaille and victorious in France. This was the 100 days period. Later defeated. by amalgation of neighboruing forces that came together (e.g., Great Britain, Pussia). Then exiled to St. Helena. Defeated in June 1815 at Waterloo.

Europe no longer the same. Treaty of Vienna did indeed try to bring back old institutions, i.e., the old status quo. But this proved to be a failure. This is because Europe witnessed a series of revolutions against the reinstatement of these old principles. Institutions that had been brought back but had to accept ruling with some constraint on the part of Parliaments (by infuence of revolutionary ideas that were still afoot, as well as the Napoleonic Code.) We have between 1815 and 1850 the definite spreading of revolutionary ideas.

???Many people argue that Treaty of Vienna brought 100 years of peace in Europe (no major wars; some minor ones did exist).

Results of these revolutions are unambiguous. For example, in 1848 series of revolutions, quite radical and democratic but they all lost. Started in February, and over by October: old rulers back in place. But these rulers had new constraints and in the long run they can be deemed sucessfull. Many countries reformed their institutions, leading to introduction to the electoral principle in places it did not exist beforehand. Also lead to enlargement of rights to vote and to the creation of new reprensentative assemblies.



Even if these reforms also fell short of what many revolutionaries wanted, by 1850 mist of Western Europe became fundamentally liberal (despite the many concessions to tradition), thus closing the cycle/circle intiated by the English Revoltions.

__Questions:__

What was the main contribution of the French Revolution to the rest of Europe? 

Why may we argue that the trajectory of the French Revolution was a confusing one?

What was the Seven Years War?
Took place in Asia (over control of India between Great Britain and France), in Europe, and in America (battle of infleunces as well).

How is the Estates General different than those institutions in Great Britain? What about Portugal?
Different to English parliament and more akin to what existed in Portugal. Represented the traditional groups in power - i.e., clergy and nobles.


What sort of violence was the French Revolution associated with? How may this have been an important feature?
Besides the internal feature, there was external violence, namely against the enemies that soon declared themselves to be agaisnt it. These enimes were more or less closely associated with the French aristocrat emigres. Nobles fled Revolutionary France into neighbouring countries and formed small armies. France was virtually at all with all of these neighbouring countries (e.g., Russia, Prussia, Spain, Sweden, Austria, many German states, and Great Britain.)

Why was Great Britain against Revolutiionary France?
Violence was shocking to British. Moreover, Great Britain did not like to have a unified Europe and would want warring between European nations to persist to mantain a balance of power. France threatened that.

What can be said was new about this conflict?
Most warring episodes in Europe were about expansion and dominance of territories. This was an idelogical war: revolution versus tradition (i.e., the monarchical order).

__TEACHER QUESTIONS - BEGIN TO BE ASKED__ at @00:47:00

* Do you think the French Revolution innovated the catalogue of liberal ideas started in the English and American revolutions?

To some extent, they did. The big innovation was going beyond the initial ‘mandate’ of liberal ideology.  E.g., atheism, revolutuonary dictator much like those later of the USSR

* [@00:50:00] Any similarities in the issues of taxation, war, and representation between French and English Revolutions?

This principle of taxation, representation, and war is revolutionary in the sense that people believe they want to enforce the terms of the social contract between individuals and the government. They can accept taxation as ong as they can make their demands heard and represented in the political sphere.

* [@00:54:00] What was the Estates General and how did from the National Constituent Assembly of 1789?

The Estates General represented an assembly in traditional terms, with three groups represented, but with the objective of aiding the King. Afterwads, it was no longer an assembly to facilitate the King’s desired, but to introduce constraints and rules on the Crown and the privileged groups of society. The assembly was for the people, in the sense they would write a constitution for the people that would place constraints on these other groups.

* [@00:56:30] Why do we consider the French Revolution to be radically idelogical? What is the contradiction here? [See again.]

Liberalism is not about giving everyone a voice to everyone in parliament; it is about guaranteeing that individuals are free to do as they wish. Napoleon wanted to liberature people, even if they did want to. By force. The destruction of existing institutions and replacement with new ones (e.g., Napoleonic code) meant that while Napoleon was not liberal, he was an agent / catalyst for liberal change

* [@01:01:30] Can we say the French Revolutionary wars were the first example of total war?

Characteristics of total war: mobilization is massive, not only on part of men, but of resources, much akin to the first and second world wars. Everything was to be directed towards the war efforts. French war was not exactly like this, but the fact that all men (not just aristocrats) would have to join the army, is an important aspect. The degree of destruction that French brought to Portuguese territory is enormous like nothing seen before (of the economy as well). In this sense, the French wars also shares similarities to the total war

* [@01:05:30] What about the reign of terror?

Jacobines not a dynasty, but a revolutionary group (Republicans actually). The purging of enemies of the revolution and the ideas they represented, notably through the use of the guillotine as a political instrument. Thousands of people (15-40k?) died and other thousands out into jails, awaiting for judgement.

* [@01:08:00] Who were Napoleon’s main enemies?

Throughout all this period, continuous enemy of France was Great Britain. All other countries signed treaties with Napoleon to establish truces, but not Great Britain. Remained at war the entire period.

* [@01:09:30] What was the Battle of Trafalgar and what were its consequences?

Date: 2 October, 1805. This was a Naval battle. South of Spain.

This was a naval engagement fought by the British Royal Navy against the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies, during the War of the Third Coalition (August–December 1805) of the Napoleonic Wars (1796–1815).

France wanted to blockade access to Great Britain. The major consequence: the damage inflicted upon Naval forces of the French was so great that it impossibilitated the French from achieving their objective of blockading access to Great Brtain.

* [@01:14:00] ‘By 18th century, most of Europe was fundamentally liberal’. Can we say this? If so, why (or why not)?

Yes, has examplified by the failure of the Treaty of Vienna, since although old institutions had been brought back

* [@01:16:30] What is the Battle of Austerlitz? 

The Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805/11 Frimaire An XIV FRC), also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, was one of the most important and decisive engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. In what is widely regarded as the greatest victory achieved by Napoleon, the Grande Armée of France defeated a larger Russian and Austrian army led by Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. 

The consequences? Allowed France to spread throughout central and eastern Europe.

[@00:47:00]
Do you think the French Revolution represents an innovation upon the catalogue of liberal ideas which had been built by the English and American revolutions?

Did not improve legacy of liberal ideas
The innovation, if you could consider it as such, was going ``beyond’’ the mandate of liberal ideology
Contributed to the diffusion of revolutionary ideas | thanks, in large part, to the use of violence on the part of Napoleon and the French Armies
E.g., coercive adoption of the Napoleonic Code
French civil code established under Napoleon in 1804
Major step in replacing existing feudal laws; extremely influential, written in a manner that was clear and accessible
First modern legal code to be adopted with a pan-European scope

[@00:50:00]
What are the similarities between the French and English revolutions in what concerns the issue of taxation and representation?

In all of the first three, major liberal revolutions, the fundamental issue was that political power was not distributed to a broad cross-section of society
``No taxation without representation’’ | one of the most famous revolutionary slogans of this era
Individuals should be free to make their own economic decisions
e.g., Stamp Act, Civil War of 1642-1651, Estates General of 1789
Willing to pay taxes as long as both parties fulfil their obligations | an acknowledgement, in the spirit of John Locke and other social contract theorists, that there is a social contract between the state and the individual; in return for concessions made by individuals, the state protects their rights

What was the Estates General and how did it differ from the National Constituent Assembly of 1789?

The Estates General represented an assembly in traditional terms, with three groups represented: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate)
Had separate assembly for each of the three Estates, which were called and dismissed by the king
Had no true power in its own right, and functioned as advisory body to the king, primarily by presenting petitions from the various estates and consulting on fiscal policy






Estates General , but with the objective of aiding the King. Afterwards, it was no longer an assembly to facilitate the King’s desired, but to introduce constraints and rules on the Crown and the privileged groups of society. The assembly was for the people, in the sense they would write a constitution for the people that would place constraints on these other groups.
