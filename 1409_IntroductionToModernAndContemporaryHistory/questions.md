**What is a free labor market?**

In the free labor market, contracting is free. You can enter and leave whenever you want. You can offer your services for free. This does not mean providing services for free. This is the possibility of us being paid fairly for our work. To contract oneself freely. In serfdom, the lords decides...

**In the article it is said that the authorities tried to take measures against the actions of the peasants? What is it that they tried to do?**

Ok, there was an attempt to try to set (cap) wages. But who asked for this? The feudal lords. Who did they asked this? They tried to set the wages but the population was reacting. They were so weakened that they asked the king to make the rule. They feudal lords were not able to enforce. In the eastern Europe it did not work while it worked on the western Europe. This shows how the black death had such an impact on the labor market.

**The discoveries increased the power of the Iberian powers. Did it give increased strength to the kings?**

All this European monarchies had representative assembly (either parliament or courts). These places are where the king would call on the society and say that he needed money and then justify. What happened with the discoveries was that the king did not need to call the Courts as they were able to monetize on the expeditions and not call the courts. They did not increase the representation of the people.

**They blamed social groups for the black plague. Which?**

Jews, women. Was this based on facts or not. It actually was as Jews died less. This was the basis. Why did they die less. Well, Jews had better hygiene habits than their European counterparts.

**Was there a lack of supply of food in the period of the black death?**

What we know was that there was a big increase in the black market. Things did not disappear. Things got more expensive as they were sold in other places. The good s did not disappear.

**This idea of contingency. What was the role of contingency in the difference between the eastern and western Europe?**

Contingency means that we can go in one direction or the other. It is not by chance, we simply do not know. There things that are not contingent.  (?)

**Can we say that Europe was overpopulated before the black death? Is this an absolute or relative concept?**

(?)

**What was the impact of the black death on the labor market?**

Yes. There was less population and therefore less pressure on these resources.

**What do you think was the impact of the black death on the price of land?**
