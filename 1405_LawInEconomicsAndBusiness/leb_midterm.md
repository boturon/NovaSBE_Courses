Human Beings normally acquire Legal personality with complete birth (and alive) and loose it upon death.

Define capacity of enjoyment.
Abstract perspective of Legal capacity, flows from the concept of inherent dignity of any person. Potentially almost All Legal persons can benefit from the ENJOYMENT of active situations (take property for example). Anyone may benefit from the situation of sitting outside in their own garden on a sunny day (even someone who has a severe mental disability) OR ( someone <18 yrs) Therefore we call THIS capacity, capacity of enjoyment: capacidade de gozo. It’s OK to make you the the focal point of ARRIVAL of these Abilities. This concept is one where we Count, static, abstract possibilities.

Define capacity of exercise.
Another very different matter is to acknowledge persons capacity to rationally exercise their rights. It is not about knowing which/how many rights/duties may be allocated to each person or entity but rather to know to what extent each person is admitted to exercise those rights and comply with those obligations without assistance. You are competent to manage all the Abilities we have ascribed you Without assistance. This concept is where we measure ability to Transform the world by yourself ( or upon your orders).

Define functioning quorum.
I would state, for example, that for the meeting to take place at least 60% of the members should be present. 60%*7=4.2/7 This means that without 4.2 members the Body cannot even FUNCTION ( so let’s assume that a threshold of 5 is established).

Define deliberation quorum.
Deliberation Quorum now states that a valid DECISION must be taken by at least 60% of favorable validly cast votes of Members present. Even though the Body has 7 component members a valid decision may here be taken by 3 favorable votes, that mathematically represent less than 50% of the composition.
