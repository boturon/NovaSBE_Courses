# Exercise 1

$x$ is $L$-intensive

\[
  \left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^H<\left(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\right)^F
\]

This implies that $H$ is exporting $x$. The H-O Theorem tells us that $H$ is $L$-abundant.

$k^H\downarrow$

What happens to production?

From A to B
$x_P\uparrow$, $y_P\downarrow\implies$ Rybczynk Theorem: After a decrease in the $k$ stock, there is a decrease in the production of the $k$-intensive sector and an increase in $L$-intensive sector.
